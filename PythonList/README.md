<li> <h3><b> Introduction to List </b> </h3> </li>

<p>The list is a data structuring method that allows storing the integers or the characters in an order indexed by starting from 0. List operations are the operations that can be performed on the data in the list data structure. A few of the basic list operations used in Python programming are extend(), insert(), append(), remove(), pop(), slice, reverse(), min() & max(), concatenate(), count(), multiply(), sort(), index(), clear(), etc.</p>

<ul>
<li>The Python List is one of the built-in data types of Python and the most flexible one. These are involved in the storage of the collection of data sets.</li>
<li>The elements of a list are in a defined order, and you can modify these elements. Either add, remove, or change the elements in the list.</li>
<li>It is easy to create the Python list; add some elements in square brackets, separating each element by comma and assigning it to a variable.</li>
<li>Python Lists allow you to perform various functions apart from simple operations like adding or deleting. You can remove any element irrespective of the position, reverse the order of the list, print the results in a specific sequence, and sort or even empty the elements in the list.</li>
</ul>
